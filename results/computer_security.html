<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Computer Security Questions</title></head><body><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Original Answer</th><th>ChatGPT Reply</th></tr><tr><td>Which of the following styles of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the following program?</td><td>Whitebox</td><td>A smart fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a program. Smart fuzzers use techniques such as symbolic execution and taint tracking to help guide the generation of test inputs in order to explore different code paths. This allows them to achieve better code coverage compared to traditional or naive fuzzers.</td></tr><tr><td>Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don't leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?
1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.
2. An attacker impersonating the server.</td><td>True, True</td><td>1. TLS protects against an attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier by using a secure handshake protocol that includes negotiated session keys and sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks.
2. TLS protects against an attacker impersonating the server by verifying the server's certificate during the handshake process, ensuring that the client is actually connecting to the intended server and not an imposter.</td></tr><tr><td>MIT's Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?</td><td>When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to the server's current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.</td><td>When a Kerberos ticket expires, it can no longer be used for authentication because the time stamp embedded in the ticket indicates that it is no longer valid. The client or service that receives the expired ticket will check the time stamp and reject the ticket if it has expired. Additionally, the Kerberos KDC server keeps track of ticket lifetimes and will not issue tickets that have expired. This ensures that expired tickets cannot be used for authentication.</td></tr><tr><td>In Message Condentiality, the transmitted message must make sense to only intended</td><td>Receiver</td><td> recipient and remain confidential to unauthorized individuals. This can be achieved through the use of encryption and secure communication channels to protect the contents of the message from being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. By ensuring message confidentiality, sensitive information can be securely shared and prevent the risk of data breaches or leaks.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is a remote Trojan?</td><td>Troya</td><td>1. Zeus
2. Mirai
3. Ratnik
4. CryptoLocker

The correct answer is: 1. Zeus</td></tr><tr><td>How do you prevent SQL injection?</td><td>Escape queries</td><td>There are several ways to prevent SQL injection attacks:

1. Use Parameterized Queries: This involves using parameterized queries where user input is treated as a parameter rather than a part of the SQL query. This helps protect against SQL injection by separating the data from the query logic.

2. Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in a SQL query. This can involve checking for data types, length, and format of the input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious characters or scripts.

3. Use Stored Procedures: Instead of directly writing SQL queries in the application code, use stored procedures which can help prevent SQL injection by limiting the impact of SQL injection attacks.

4. Escape User Input: If parameterized queries or stored procedures are not feasible, escape user input by using functions like mysqli_real_escape_string() in PHP or addslashes() in other languages to escape special characters.

5. Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks: ORM frameworks such as Hibernate in Java or Entity Framework in .NET can help prevent SQL injection by abstracting the database interactions and handling input validation and sanitization internally.

6. Limit Database Permissions: Ensure that the database user account used by the application has the minimum required permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification of database tables.

7. Regularly Update and Patch: Keep the database management system and application frameworks up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.

By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and ensure the security of your application and database.</td></tr><tr><td>What does it mean to "be stealthy" during a penetration test?</td><td>Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services</td><td>Being stealthy during a penetration test means conducting the test in a way that minimizes the chances of being detected by the target organization's security controls and systems. This often involves using stealthy techniques and tactics to avoid triggering alarms, alerts, or other defensive mechanisms that could alert the organization to the penetration test. This allows the penetration tester to more accurately assess the security posture of the organization and provide valuable insights without causing disruption or harm.</td></tr><tr><td>In Brumley and Boneh's paper on side-channel attacks, why does blinding prevent the timing attack from working?</td><td>Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary's input and the timing differences.</td><td>Blinding prevents the timing attack from working because it masks the actual timing of the computation being performed. By introducing random delays or dummy operations into the computation, the timing of the operation becomes unpredictable and consistent regardless of the input or operation being performed. This makes it difficult for an attacker to measure the exact timing of the computation and extract sensitive information through side-channel attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>The openSSL implementation described in "Remote Timing Attacks are Practical" (by Brumley and Boneh) uses the following performance optimizations: Chinese Remainder (CR), Montgomery Representation (MR), Karatsuba Multiplication (KM), and Repeated squaring and Sliding windows (RS). Which of the following options would close the timing channel attack described in the paper if you turned the listed optimizations off?
1. RS and KM
2. RS and MR</td><td>False, True</td><td>
3. CR and MR</td></tr><tr><td>Public key encryption is advantageous over Symmetric key Cryptography because of</td><td>Key exchange</td><td> the following reasons:

1. Security: Public key encryption provides greater security as it uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This means that the encryption key can be shared with anyone, while the decryption key is kept secret, making it harder for attackers to intercept and decrypt messages.

2. Key exchange: With public key encryption, there is no need for both parties to exchange a secret key beforehand. This simplifies the process of secure communication, as the public key can be freely distributed without compromising the security of the system.

3. Scalability: Public key encryption allows for secure communication between multiple parties without the need for each pair of users to share a unique secret key. This makes it easier to scale the encryption system to accommodate a larger number of users.

4. Authentication: Public key encryption can also be used for digital signatures and authentication, providing additional security measures to verify the identity of the sender and ensure the integrity of the message.

5. Key management: Public key encryption simplifies key management as each user only needs to keep track of their own private key, while the public key can be stored in a centralized directory. This reduces the complexity of key distribution and storage in large-scale encryption systems.</td></tr><tr><td>The __________ was a huge marketplace of Dark Web specifically famous for selling of illegal drugs & narcotics as well as you can find a wide range of other goods for sale.</td><td>Silk Road</td><td>Silk Road</td></tr><tr><td>The ______________ is categorized as an unknown segment of the Deep Web which has been purposely kept hidden & is inaccessible using standard web browsers.</td><td>Dark web</td><td>Dark Web</td></tr><tr><td>What does EXE do when the STP solver times out on a constraint query for a particular path?</td><td>Assume that the query is not satisfiable and stop executing the path</td><td>When the STP solver times out on a constraint query for a particular path, EXE will prioritize completing the execution of the program with other inputs and may discard the current path that has timed out. EXE may also log a warning or error message to indicate that the constraint query did not complete successfully for that particular path.</td></tr><tr><td>Suppose you want to use fuzzing on a program to try to find memory errors; which of the following statements is true?</td><td>Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make the source of a memory error easier to find</td><td>Fuzzing is a technique used to find vulnerabilities, such as memory errors, in a program by inputting random or invalid data to see how the program reacts. So, the true statement is: Fuzzing can be used to find memory errors in a program.</td></tr><tr><td>What tool can be used to perform SNMP enumeration?</td><td>IP Network Browser</td><td>There are a few tools that can be used to perform SNMP enumeration, including:

1. SNMP Walk: This is a command line tool that can be used to perform SNMP enumeration by walking through the SNMP tree to gather information about a device.

2. SNMPUtil: This is a graphical user interface tool that can be used to perform SNMP enumeration by querying SNMP-enabled devices.

3. Nmap: This network scanning tool can also be used to perform SNMP enumeration by using the SNMP script to gather information about devices on a network.

4. SolarWinds SNMP Enabler: This is a tool specifically designed for SNMP enumeration and can be used to discover SNMP-enabled devices and gather information about them.</td></tr><tr><td>Which among them has the strongest wireless security?</td><td>WPA3</td><td>It is difficult to determine which device has the strongest wireless security without more specific information about the security features and protocols used by each device. Generally, devices that use the latest encryption standards, such as WPA3, and offer additional security features such as multi-factor authentication, automatic firmware updates, and built-in firewall protection would be considered to have strong wireless security. It is recommended to research and compare the security features of each device to determine which one offers the strongest wireless security.</td></tr><tr><td>Suppose Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting file descriptors from a parent on fork and exec. What aspects of the OKWS design would break without file descriptor passing?
1. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser.
2. It would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user.</td><td>True, False</td><td>3. Okd would not be able to handle multiple requests simultaneously, as it would not be able to pass file descriptors for socket connections between processes. 
4. The scalability and performance of OKWS would be severely impacted, as it heavily relies on passing file descriptors efficiently for handling connections. 
5. Features such as load balancing and efficient handling of client requests across multiple worker processes would not be possible without the ability to pass file descriptors.</td></tr><tr><td>Failed sessions allow brute-force attacks on access credentials. This type of attacks are done in which layer of the OSI model?</td><td>Session layer</td><td>Brute-force attacks on access credentials are typically done at the application layer of the OSI model. This is because these attacks involve trying multiple combinations of usernames and passwords in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or application. By repeatedly attempting to log in with different credentials, an attacker can eventually crack the password through trial and error, making the application layer vulnerable to such attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is an authentication method?</td><td>All of the above</td><td>- Password authentication
- Biometric authentication
- Two-factor authentication</td></tr><tr><td>When does a buffer overflow occur, generally speaking?</td><td>when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it</td><td>A buffer overflow generally occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. This can happen due to programming errors, such as not properly checking the size of input data before writing it to a buffer, or not allocating enough memory for the buffer in the first place.</td></tr><tr><td>A digital signature needs a</td><td>Public-key system</td><td> public key and a private key. The public key is used to verify the authenticity of the signature, while the private key is used to create the signature. The private key is kept secret and should only be known to the owner of the signature. This secure key pair ensures that only the owner of the signature can create a valid digital signature.</td></tr><tr><td>A packet filter firewall filters at the</td><td>Network or transport layer</td><td> network layer of the OSI model, specifically at the IP packet level. It examines the header information of each packet passing through the firewall, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type, to determine whether to allow or block the packet based on a set of predefined rules.</td></tr><tr><td>Let I = (S,V)I=(S,V) be a MAC. Suppose S(k,m)S(k,m) is always 5 bits long. Can this MAC be secure?</td><td>No, an attacker can simply guess the tag for messages</td><td>No, this MAC cannot be secure if the output of the signing function S(k,m) is always 5 bits long. With only 5 bits, there are only 2^5 = 32 possible unique outputs, which makes it susceptible to brute force attacks. An attacker could try all possible 5-bit strings until finding a valid signature, compromising the security of the MAC. Additionally, a shorter output length increases the likelihood of collisions, where different messages result in the same signature, further weakening the security of the MAC.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following deals with network intrusion detection and real-time traffic analysis?</td><td>Snort</td><td>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</td></tr><tr><td>The Message condentiality or privacy means that the sender and the receiver expect</td><td>Condentiality</td><td> that the content of their communication will remain confidential and not be accessed or disclosed by any unauthorized parties. This can be achieved through encryption, secure communication channels, and proper data handling procedures. Protecting the confidentiality of messages is important for maintaining trust and ensuring sensitive information is kept secure.</td></tr><tr><td>When a wireless user authenticates to any AP, both of them go in the course of four-step authentication progression which is called _____________</td><td>4-way handshake</td><td>the 802.1X authentication process.</td></tr><tr><td>Message authentication is a service beyond</td><td>Message Integrity</td><td> ensuring the integrity of a message. It also includes verifying the authenticity of the sender and receiver of the message. This helps prevent unauthorized individuals from tampering with or intercepting the message. Message authentication is essential for maintaining the security and confidentiality of communications, especially in sensitive or confidential transactions. It is a crucial component of secure communication protocols and plays a vital role in protecting against potential security threats and attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following are most vulnerable to injection attacks?</td><td>SQL queries based on user input</td><td>- Web applications
- APIs
- SQL databases</td></tr><tr><td>Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don't leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?
1. An attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker's own choosing.
2. An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client.</td><td>True, True</td><td>TLS protects against both of the mentioned attacks:
1. TLS uses symmetric encryption to protect the integrity of the communication between client and server, so an attacker would not be able to replace bytes sent by the client with their own chosen bytes without detection.
2. TLS encrypts the data being sent between the client and server, so an attacker would not be able to read the plaintext bytes being sent by the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is a Wireless traffic Sniffing tool?</td><td>Wireshark</td><td>Aircrack-ng</td></tr><tr><td>A ___________ is a method in which a computer security mechanism is bypassed untraceable for accessing the computer or its information.</td><td>backdoor</td><td>hack</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is not a block cipher operating mode?</td><td>CBF</td><td>The following is not a block cipher operating mode:

- Key exchange</td></tr><tr><td>What is a web proxy?</td><td>A piece of software that intercepts and possibly modifies requests (and responses) between a web browser and web server</td><td>A web proxy is a tool or service that acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. When a user accesses a website through a web proxy, their request is first sent to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the website on behalf of the user. This can help users bypass geo-restrictions, access blocked websites, improve privacy by hiding their IP address, and enhance security by encrypting their internet traffic.</td></tr><tr><td>Buffer-overflow may remain as a bug in apps if __________ are not done fully.</td><td>boundary checks</td><td>input validation and proper memory management</td></tr><tr><td>Applications developed by programming languages like ____ and ______ have this common buffer-overflow error.</td><td>C, C++</td><td>C and C++</td></tr><tr><td>Encryption and decryption provide secrecy, or condentiality, but not</td><td>Integrity</td><td>integrity or authenticity. These are separate security measures that ensure the data has not been altered or tampered with and that it comes from a trusted source. Encryption and decryption protect the contents of a message from being read by unauthorized parties, but they do not guarantee the integrity or authenticity of the message itself. Additional security measures, such as digital signatures or message authentication codes, are needed to provide these assurances.</td></tr><tr><td>The sub key length at each round of DES is__________</td><td>56</td><td>The subkey length at each round of DES is 48 bits.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is true of mutation-based fuzzing?</td><td>It generates each different input by modifying a prior input</td><td>Mutation-based fuzzing generates new inputs for a program by making small changes to existing inputs.</td></tr><tr><td>What are the types of scanning?</td><td>Network, vulnerability, and port </td><td>There are several types of scanning, including:

1. Document scanning: Converting physical documents into digital files for storage and easy access.

2. Image scanning: Capturing digital images of photos, artwork, or other visual media.

3. Barcode scanning: Reading and interpreting barcodes for inventory management and tracking purposes.

4. QR code scanning: Reading QR codes to access digital content or information.

5. Network scanning: Identifying devices connected to a network and checking for vulnerabilities or security risks.

6. Vulnerability scanning: Identifying weaknesses in a system or network that could be exploited by hackers.

7. Port scanning: Identifying open ports on a network to assess security risks.

8. Virus scanning: Checking files or systems for malicious software or viruses.

9. Penetration testing: Simulating a cyberattack to test the security of a system or network.</td></tr><tr><td>A sender must not be able to deny sending a message that was sent, is known as</td><td>Message Nonrepudiation</td><td> message integrity.</td></tr><tr><td>A proxy rewall lters at the</td><td>Application layer</td><td> network level, acting as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. It can be configured to block or allow certain types of traffic based on predefined rules or policies. This type of filtering can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, restrict access to certain websites or applications, and protect against malware and other security threats.Proxy firewalls can also provide additional privacy and anonymity by masking the user's IP address and location when accessing the internet.</td></tr><tr><td>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) belongs to which Internet Security Protocol?</td><td>Secure IP Protocol</td><td>ESP belongs to the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol suite.</td></tr><tr><td>A special tool is necessary for entering the network which is _______________ that helps the anonymous internet users to access into the Tor's network and use various Tor services.</td><td>Tor browser</td><td>a Tor browser</td></tr><tr><td>How does a buffer overflow on the stack facilitate running attacker-injected code?</td><td>By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code</td><td>A buffer overflow on the stack can facilitate running attacker-injected code by overwriting the return address of a function call on the stack with the address of the injected code. This can happen when a program copies more data into a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting critical information such as the return address.

When the function that has been exploited returns, the program will jump to the address that the attacker has placed in the return address location, instead of returning to the legitimate caller. This allows the attacker to hijack the control flow of the program and execute arbitrary code, which is often malicious in nature.

By taking advantage of a buffer overflow vulnerability on the stack, an attacker can inject and execute their own code within the context of the vulnerable program, potentially gaining unauthorized access, stealing sensitive information, or causing the program to perform unauthorized actions.</td></tr><tr><td>The digest created by a hash function is normally called a</td><td>Modication detection code (MDC)</td><td>hash value or hash code.</td></tr><tr><td>Old operating systems like _______ and NT-based systems have buffer-overflow attack a common vulnerability.</td><td>UNIX</td><td>Windows 95/98 and Windows NT-based systems</td></tr><tr><td>What is a replay attack?</td><td>The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accept its and responds in the attacker's favor</td><td>A replay attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and retransmits data that was previously captured in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system or impersonate a legitimate user. This type of attack often involves capturing authentication data, such as login credentials or session tokens, and replaying them to gain access to a system or service. replay attacks are a common threat in network security and can be mitigated through the use of encryption, authentication mechanisms, and other security measures.</td></tr><tr><td>Statement 1| A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user's computer from stealing the user's second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user's computer is turned off. Statement 2| A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.</td><td>True, False</td><td>Statement 1 is true. A U2F USB dongle provides an additional layer of security by requiring physical presence and interaction with the device for authentication, making it resistant to malware attacks on the user's computer.

Statement 2 is also true. U2F technology ensures that the user is physically present with the device at the time of authentication, providing an extra level of assurance that the person attempting to login is actually the legitimate user.</td></tr><tr><td>____________________ is the anticipation of unauthorized access or break to computers or data by means of wireless networks.</td><td>Wireless security</td><td>Wireless intrusion detection</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following are benefits of penetration testing?</td><td>Results are often reproducible</td><td>1.

2. Providing recommendations for improving security defenses and mitigating risks.
3. Demonstrating the potential impact of a successful cyber attack on an organization.
4. Helping organizations comply with regulatory requirements and security standards.
5. Increasing awareness and understanding of security risks among stakeholders.
6. Enhancing incident response capabilities by identifying and addressing security gaps.</td></tr></table></body></html>
