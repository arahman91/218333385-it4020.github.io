 or military conflicts. The Minoans are known for their peaceful and 
prosperous society, as evidenced by their impressive architecture, 
complex social structure, and vibrant artistic achievements. There is 
very little evidence of military fortifications, weapons, or depictions 
of warfare in Minoan art and architecture, suggesting that they may have
 been a peaceful and trade-oriented civilization.</td></tr><tr><td>The greatest Egyptian pyramids at Giza were built:</td><td>as burial monuments for the pharaoh Khufu, Khufu's son Khafre, and Khufu's grandson Menkaure.</td><td>around
 4,500 years ago during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom period, 
specifically between 2580 and 2560 BC. The three main pyramids at Giza 
are the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the Great Pyramid), the Pyramid 
of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. These monumental structures were
 built as tombs for the pharaohs and are considered some of the most 
impressive and enduring architectural achievements in history.</td></tr><tr><td>When anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Middle East, who did they encounter?</td><td>Neandertals, the evolutionary descendants of the premodern human inhabitants of Europe and Asia</td><td>When
 anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Middle East, they 
encountered various groups of prehistoric humans, such as Neanderthals 
and Homo erectus. These encounters likely led to interactions and 
sometimes interbreeding between different human species.</td></tr><tr><td>At its peak, the palace at Knossos is thought to have had over _________ rooms.</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,300 rooms.</td></tr><tr><td>The
 Hopewell were complex rank societies, but they were not a state. 
Hopewell culture lacked all of the following elements EXCEPT:</td><td>monumental earthworks</td><td>A system of taxation.</td></tr><tr><td>Markings found on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol are probably:</td><td>intended to identify the local group that had produced them.</td><td>hieroglyphs or other forms of ancient writing, symbols, decorative designs, or religious icons.</td></tr><tr><td>The 30 upright stones at Stonehenge are called _______; the horizontal stones are _________.</td><td>sarsens, lintels</td><td>The 30 upright stones at Stonehenge are called sarsens, while the horizontal stones are called lintels.</td></tr><tr><td>The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies may have been an evolutionary solution, in that:</td><td>it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.</td><td>

1. It allowed for a longer period of postnatal brain development, 
leading to increased cognitive abilities and learning capacity.
2. It may have facilitated the development of more complex social 
interactions and behaviors, as infants require more care and attention 
from their caregivers.
3. It could have increased the chances of survival for infants by 
ensuring they receive the necessary care and protection from their 
parents.
4. It may have helped strengthen the bond between parents and offspring,
 leading to increased parental investment and support.
5. It could have allowed for a greater flexibility in the timing of 
birth, as infants are less dependent on immediate external resources for
 survival.</td></tr><tr><td>Research on C3 and C4 pathways indicates 
that changes in plant communities were associated with a transition in 
the diets of ancient hominids from:</td><td>nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses.</td><td>primarily
 consuming C3 plants to incorporating more C4 plants. This transition is
 believed to have occurred around 3.5 million years ago, coinciding with
 the emergence of early hominids such as Australopithecus. The shift in 
diet is thought to be related to changes in climate and vegetation, as 
C4 plants are typically more abundant in dry, open habitats compared to 
C3 plants. This dietary shift may have provided early hominids with a 
more reliable source of food in changing environments.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is evidence of new uses for plants during the Middle Stone Age?</td><td>plant material lining the floor of Sibudu Cave in South Africa</td><td>1. The discovery of grinding stones used for processing plant material
2. Residue analysis on tools showing the presence of plant material
3. Charred plant remains found in archaeological sites 
4. Evidence of storage pits for storing plant foods</td></tr><tr><td>That modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA indicates that:</td><td>Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.</td><td>they
 did not interbreed with Neandertals like other non-African populations 
did. This suggests that modern Africans do not share a common ancestor 
with Neandertals and likely did not come into contact with them during 
their migration out of Africa.</td></tr><tr><td>Toward the end of the 
Pleistocene, between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago, worldwide sea level 
was much lower than present day, resulting in the exposure of a landmass
 east of Siberia called __________. This period is called the _______.</td><td>Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum</td><td>The
 landmass exposed east of Siberia was called Beringia. This period 
during the late Pleistocene is known as the Last Glacial Maximum.</td></tr><tr><td>Which archaeological method is best for identifying large-scale land modifications?</td><td>aerial photography</td><td>Remote
 sensing is the best archaeological method for identifying large-scale 
land modifications. This method typically involves the use of aerial 
photography, satellite imagery, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) 
technology, and other advanced techniques to detect and analyze changes 
to the landscape over time. Remote sensing can provide a comprehensive 
view of entire landscapes, making it highly effective for identifying 
large-scale land modifications such as agricultural terraces, roads, 
canals, and other human-made features.</td></tr><tr><td>What designation for a pottery style was eventually applied to an entire cultural complex that moved across the Pacific?</td><td>Lapita</td><td>Lapita pottery style</td></tr><tr><td>What is one of the differences between simple foragers and complex foragers?</td><td>Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.</td><td>One
 of the differences between simple foragers and complex foragers is 
their social organization. Simple foragers typically live in small, more
 egalitarian groups with less formalized leadership structures, while 
complex foragers often have larger, more hierarchical societies with 
distinct social roles and leadership positions.</td></tr><tr><td>The significance of Frere's discovery was that what he found was located:</td><td>beneath the remains of extinct animals.</td><td>
 in an untouched and well-preserved archaeological site, providing 
valuable insight into an ancient civilization and their way of life.</td></tr><tr><td>What is the earliest form of writing in the world and where did it develop?</td><td>cuneiform, in Mesopotamia</td><td>The
 earliest form of writing in the world is believed to be Sumerian 
cuneiform script, which developed in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day 
Iraq) around 3200 BC.</td></tr><tr><td>A pattern of social integration in which individuals are placed into a hierarchy of social levels is called:</td><td>social stratification.</td><td>Social stratification</td></tr><tr><td>The Minoan economy may have been especially vulnerable to natural catastrophe because it relied heavily on:</td><td>maritime trade</td><td>1.
 Agriculture: The Minoans were largely dependent on agricultural 
activities for their economy, such as growing crops like barley, olives,
 and grapes. Any natural disasters such as droughts, floods, or storms 
could have significantly impacted their ability to produce food.

2. Trade: The Minoans were also known for their extensive trade networks
 in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, relying on imports and exports
 of goods such as pottery, textiles, and metals. Any disruptions to 
these trade routes due to natural disasters could have had negative 
effects on their economy.

3. Maritime activities: The Minoans were skilled seafarers and engaged 
in maritime activities such as fishing and transport of goods by sea. 
Any disturbances in the maritime environment, such as storms or rough 
seas, could have hindered their ability to carry out these activities 
effectively.

Overall, the heavy reliance on agriculture, trade, and maritime 
activities made the Minoan economy susceptible to natural disasters that
 could disrupt these key sectors and lead to economic instability.</td></tr><tr><td>The _______ developed one of the earliest kingdoms in South America, reaching its height at around _________.</td><td>Moche; AD 400</td><td>Inca civilization; around 1500 AD.</td></tr><tr><td>What
 is the name of the lithic technology seen in the Arctic and consisting 
of wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins?</td><td>Denali Complex</td><td>The
 technology seen in the Arctic with wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, 
bifacial knives, and burins is known as the Denbigh Flint Complex.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is used to remove the soil enclosing site materials?</td><td>all of the above</td><td>Excavation is used to remove the soil enclosing site materials.</td></tr><tr><td>A continuous, projecting ridge of bone above and across the eye orbits is called the:</td><td>supraorbital torus.</td><td>supraorbital ridge.</td></tr><tr><td>Ancestral Puebloan culture in Chaco Canyon was comprised of:</td><td>around 75 substantial settlements and more than 300 smaller communities.</td><td>1.

called "Great Houses" and intricate kivas (ceremonial gathering spaces).
2. A sophisticated social and political organization, with evidence of 
hierarchy and leadership roles within the community.
3. Advanced agriculture techniques, such as terraced farming and water 
management systems to support a growing population.
4. Extensive trade networks, with evidence of goods being exchanged with
 other cultures as far away as present-day Mexico.
5. Rich artistic and cultural traditions, including intricate pottery, 
textiles, and petroglyphs that reflect their spiritual beliefs and 
connection to the natural world.</td></tr><tr><td>The Yang-shao culture gave way to the Lung-Shan sometime after:</td><td>5,000 B.P.</td><td> 3000 BC.</td></tr><tr><td>The most prominent feature of the food resource base of post-Pleistocene Europe was its:</td><td>diversity.</td><td>transition
 from a reliance on hunting large game animals to a more diversified 
diet including a variety of plant foods such as grains, fruits, and 
vegetables. This shift in diet was likely influenced by the extinction 
of many large game animals during the Pleistocene era and the 
introduction of agriculture during the Neolithic period. The cultivation
 of crops and domestication of animals provided a more reliable and 
sustainable food source for early European populations.</td></tr><tr><td>Evidence of wild grain harvesting and consumption in Israel dates to as early as</td><td>20,000 B.P.</td><td>
 23,000 years ago. In the Ohalo II site near the Sea of Galilee, 
archaeologists have found evidence of nuts, seeds, and grains that were 
likely collected and consumed by the inhabitants of the area during the 
Upper Paleolithic period. This provides insights into the early stages 
of human agriculture and the domestication of grains in the region.</td></tr><tr><td>Civilization in the Indus Valley was characterized by:</td><td>all of the above.</td><td>
1. Well-planned cities and sophisticated urban planning, with streets 
laid out in a grid pattern and advanced drainage systems.

2. Advanced techniques in pottery, metallurgy, and agriculture, 
including the use of bronze and copper tools and irrigation systems.

3. Trade networks that extended to Mesopotamia and other regions, 
evidence of a thriving economy and long-distance trade.

4. The use of a written script, which has yet to be fully deciphered, 
indicating a sophisticated system of communication.

5. The presence of elaborate public buildings, such as the Great Bath at
 Mohenjo-Daro, suggesting a highly organized society with a strong 
central authority.

6. Evidence of a complex social structure, with a ruling elite, skilled 
artisans, and a labor force for agricultural production.

7. Advanced city planning and engineering techniques, such as the 
construction of defensive walls and the use of standardized bricks.

Overall, civilization in the Indus Valley was highly developed and 
marked by technological advancements, economic prosperity, and social 
organization.</td></tr><tr><td>According to one theory, the power of Ancestral Pueblo elites emerged when certain groups:</td><td>stored food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years.</td><td>were
 able to control and distribute valuable resources such as food, water, 
and land. By controlling access to these resources, they were able to 
establish themselves as leaders and gain power and influence within 
their communities. They may have also used their control over these 
resources to establish trade networks and alliances with other groups, 
further solidifying their power and elite status.</td></tr><tr><td>Evidence from northwest coast societies indicates that what is ultimately needed for the development of social complexity is:</td><td>a food surplus.</td><td>1.
 Surplus food production: Northwest coast societies were able to achieve
 social complexity due to the abundance of natural resources in their 
region, particularly salmon and other fish. This allowed for the 
development of surplus food production, which in turn enabled the growth
 of larger populations and more specialized occupations.

2. Specialization of labor: As surplus food production allowed for 
larger populations, individuals were able to specialize in different 
occupations, such as fishing, hunting, gathering, and crafting. This 
specialization of labor helped to create a more diverse and complex 
social structure within these societies.

3. Social stratification: The presence of surplus food production and 
specialization of labor led to the development of social stratification 
within northwest coast societies. This resulted in the emergence of 
social classes, with some individuals holding more power, resources, and
 privileges than others.

4. Trade networks: Northwest coast societies engaged in extensive trade 
networks with neighboring groups, exchanging goods, resources, and 
cultural practices. These trade networks facilitated the exchange of 
valuable resources and ideas, contributing to the development of social 
complexity within these societies.

In conclusion, evidence from northwest coast societies indicates that 
surplus food production, specialization of labor, social stratification,
 and trade networks are ultimately needed for the development of social 
complexity. These factors enabled these societies to grow, diversify, 
and establish more complex social structures over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Which subfield of anthropology aims to better understand the nearest living relatives of humans?</td><td>primatology</td><td>Primatology.</td></tr><tr><td>How did Aurignacian technology differ from Mousterian technology?</td><td>Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.</td><td>Aurignacian
 technology differed from Mousterian technology in several key ways:

1. Aurignacian tools were more sophisticated and finely crafted than 
Mousterian tools. They were often made from bone, antler, and ivory, in 
addition to stone.

2. Aurignacian tools were more specialized and purposefully designed for
 specific tasks, such as engraving, sewing, and crafting jewelry. 
Mousterian tools, on the other hand, were more multi-purpose and 
general-use tools.

3. Aurignacian tool technology included new innovations such as the 
pressure flaking technique for making finely retouched blades and 
points, as well as the use of hafting (attaching a stone tool to a 
handle) for improved efficiency and precision.

4. Aurignacian people had a wider range of raw materials available to 
them for tool-making, allowing for greater diversity and innovation in 
their tool technology.

Overall, Aurignacian technology represented a significant advancement in
 tool-making capabilities and sophistication compared to the earlier 
Mousterian technology.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following is evidence of a complex society?</td><td>monumental works</td><td>- Advanced monumental architecture such as pyramids or temples

underworld.</td></tr><tr><td>The above hominid species discovered in Malapa Cave in South Africa has been classified as:</td><td>Australopithecus sediba.</td><td>Australopithecus sediba</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnographic evidence supports which of the following connections between surplus food and social complexity?</td><td>Some
 resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can
 lead to economic inequalities and social complexity.</td><td>1. Surplus food allows for the development of specialized labor roles within a society, leading to increased social complexity.
2. Surplus food enables the centralization of power and resources, leading to the emergence of more complex social hierarchies.
3. Surplus food can support larger populations, allowing for the growth and expansion of a society's territory and influence.
4. Surplus food can be used as a form of wealth and status, leading to increased social stratification within a society.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following was the greatest advantage of using fire in human evolution?</td><td>Fire makes meat more digestible and kills bacteria.</td><td>The
 ability to cook food was the greatest advantage of using fire in human 
evolution. Cooking food made it more digestible, provided more 
nutrients, killed bacteria and parasites, and allowed for a wider 
variety of foods to be consumed. This played a significant role in the 
development of the human brain and body, leading to advancements in 
intelligence, social structures, and overall survival.</td></tr><tr><td>Palynology is the study of _________, which allows scientists to reconstruct ______.</td><td>pollen; plant communities and climate.</td><td>Palynology is the study of pollen and spores, which allows scientists to reconstruct past environments and climate conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>What was the unifying element of Olmec culture?</td><td>religious iconography</td><td>The
 unifying element of Olmec culture was their religion and belief system,
 which revolved around the worship of different gods and spirits 
represented by anthropomorphic figures, animals, and natural elements. 
This religion played a central role in all aspects of Olmec society, 
including art, architecture, and daily life. The Olmecs also shared a 
common language, religious rituals, and cultural practices that helped 
to create a sense of shared identity among different communities within 
the Olmec civilization.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following ancient civilizations has a written language that is the furthest from being fully deciphered?</td><td>the Indus Valley</td><td>The Indus Valley civilization has a written language that is the furthest from being fully deciphered.</td></tr><tr><td>The sophisticated stone tool making industry at the Pinnacle Point site in South Africa is evidence of:</td><td>a 71,000-year-old complex sequence of microblade production and use.</td><td>advanced cognitive abilities and complex social organization among early humans.</td></tr><tr><td>Early evidence of complexity in Mayan societies is suggested by the appearance, around 2650 B.P., of:</td><td>decorated stepped platforms.</td><td>- Large-scale monumental architecture
- Elaborate tombs and burial rituals
- Elaborate artwork and pottery
- Hieroglyphic writing 
- Sophisticated agricultural techniques 
- Complex social and political organization</td></tr><tr><td>What do anthropologists NOT need to know to determine when people entered the Americas from Siberia?</td><td>When sled dogs were first domesticated</td><td>Anthropologists
 do not need to know specific details about the technologies, languages,
 or cultures of the individuals who entered the Americas from Siberia in
 order to determine when this migration occurred. They primarily rely on
 archaeological evidence, such as the presence of stone tools and other 
artifacts, as well as genetic research and dating techniques to 
establish an estimated timeline for when humans first arrived in the 
Americas from Siberia.</td></tr><tr><td>What do the Hassunan and Samarran sites in Mesopotamia have in common?</td><td>Both relied heavily on agriculture.</td><td>The
 Hassunan and Samarran sites in Mesopotamia both represent important 
Neolithic settlements in the region. They were both centers of early 
agricultural and urban development, with evidence of advanced irrigation
 techniques, complex social organization, and sophisticated 
architecture. Additionally, both the Hassunan and Samarran cultures were
 influential in shaping the development of later Mesopotamian 
civilizations, such as the Sumerians and Akkadians.</td></tr><tr><td>Which crop is South America's most significant agricultural contribution to Europe?</td><td>potatoes</td><td>The
 most significant agricultural contribution from South America to Europe
 is likely soybeans. Soybeans are a major crop in South America, 
particularly in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. These
 countries are among the largest producers of soybeans in the world, and
 a significant portion of their production is exported to Europe, where 
it is used for various purposes such as animal feed, biofuels, and food 
products. Soybeans have become an important part of European 
agricultural imports and play a key role in the global food supply 
chain.</td></tr><tr><td>What distinguishes the trade patterns of the Mesolithic from those of the Upper Paleolithic?</td><td>in the Mesolithic, goods traveled less far but more goods were exchanged</td><td>The
 trade patterns of the Mesolithic period were characterized by an 
increased specialization in the procurement and exchange of goods, 
whereas the Upper Paleolithic trade patterns were more focused on local 
exchanges and the sharing of resources within small social groups.

In the Mesolithic period, there is evidence of long-distance trade 
networks, as hunter-gatherer societies began to engage in the exchange 
of specialized goods such as obsidian, shells, and flint tools over 
greater distances. This suggests that Mesolithic populations had 
developed more complex social structures and economies, allowing for the
 establishment of trade relationships with neighboring groups.

On the other hand, in the Upper Paleolithic period, trade was more 
localized and focused on the sharing of resources within small social 
groups. While there is evidence of the exchange of goods between 
different groups, this trade was typically limited to nearby communities
 and did not involve the elaborate systems of exchange seen in the 
Mesolithic period.

Overall, the trade patterns of the Mesolithic period reflect a greater 
degree of social complexity and integration, as well as a more advanced 
level of economic specialization compared to the Upper Paleolithic 
period.</td></tr><tr><td>A celebration in which wealth is redistributed is called a:</td><td>potlatch.</td><td>wealth redistribution party.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
