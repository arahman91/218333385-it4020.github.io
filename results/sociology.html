<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"><title>sociology Questions</title></head><body><table><tbody><tr><th>Question</th><th>Original Answer</th><th>ChatGPT Reply</th></tr><tr><td>Mass-society theory suggests that:</td><td>the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers</td><td>
 modern societies are characterized by a lack of individuality and a 
conformist, homogenized culture due to the influence of mass media, mass
 production, and mass consumption. This theory posits that individuals 
in mass societies are easily influenced and manipulated by powerful 
forces such as government, corporations, and the media, leading to a 
loss of autonomy and critical thinking skills. Mass-society theory also 
argues that social cohesion is eroded in mass societies, leading to 
alienation and a sense of disconnection among individuals.</td></tr><tr><td>The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:</td><td>how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources</td><td>
1. The relationship between urban environments and social interactions 
2. The impact of city planning and infrastructure on social behavior 
3. The role of natural landscapes and green spaces in promoting community well-being 
4. The dynamics of resource distribution and environmental sustainability in urban areas 
5. The connection between population density and social organization 
6. The influence of pollution, noise, and other environmental factors on quality of life in urban settings.</td></tr><tr><td>Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was:</td><td>learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career</td><td> "harmless."</td></tr><tr><td>The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were:</td><td>all of the above</td><td>1.
 Industrialists and businessmen: These individuals were able to take 
advantage of the rapidly growing industrial economy by investing in and 
managing businesses in sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, 
and finance.

2. Professionals: Professionals such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and
 accountants also became a prominent part of the middle class. They 
relied on their specialized skills and education to earn a comfortable 
living.

3. White-collar workers: With the rise of office-based jobs in sectors 
such as banking, insurance, and government, a new class of white-collar 
workers emerged. These individuals performed administrative, managerial,
 and clerical tasks and typically enjoyed higher salaries and job 
security compared to blue-collar workers.

4. Educators: Teachers and professors also became part of the middle 
class, as education became more valued and accessible during this 
period. Many educators were able to secure stable employment and 
contribute to their communities through their work in schools and 
universities.

5. Small business owners: Small business owners, such as shopkeepers and
 artisans, played a crucial role in local economies and communities. 
They were able to leverage their entrepreneurial skills to sustain their
 businesses and provide for their families.

6. Civil servants: Government employees, including bureaucrats, police 
officers, and postal workers, were another important segment of the 
middle class. They benefited from job security, pensions, and other 
perks associated with working for the government.

Overall, the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century 
were diverse and dynamic, encompassing a range of occupations and 
professions. They were characterized by their relative economic 
stability, social mobility, and aspirations for upward mobility.</td></tr><tr><td>Technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to:</td><td>all of the above</td><td> monitor individuals, track movements, gather data on behaviors, and conduct mass surveillance on large populations.</td></tr><tr><td>There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because:</td><td>growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits</td><td>1.
 Globalization: The increase in global trade and competition may have 
benefited some individuals and industries, leading to higher incomes for
 those at the top of the income distribution, while others may have seen
 their incomes stagnate or decrease.

2. Technology: The rise of automation and advancements in technology may
 have eliminated certain jobs or shifted the demand for labor to 
high-skilled workers, leading to higher incomes for those with the 
necessary skills, but leaving others behind.

3. Deregulation: The loosening of regulations in industries such as 
finance and telecommunications may have allowed for greater accumulation
 of wealth among the already wealthy, further widening the income gap.

4. Changes in taxation: Tax policies in the 1980s, such as cuts to 
income tax rates for the highest income earners, may have contributed to
 the growth in income inequality by allowing those at the top to keep 
more of their earnings.

5. Decline of unions: The weakening of labor unions in the 1980s may 
have reduced the bargaining power of workers, leading to stagnant wages 
for many while executives and shareholders saw their incomes rise.

6. Executive compensation: The rise in executive pay, particularly in 
the form of stock options and bonuses, may have contributed to growing 
income inequality as top executives saw significant increases in their 
earnings while lower-level employees did not experience similar gains.</td></tr><tr><td>If a deviant act is 'normalized', it is:</td><td>seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character</td><td>When
 a deviant act is normalized, it means that society begins to accept and
 view the behavior as more common or less problematic than before. This 
could occur through changes in cultural attitudes, shifts in laws or 
policies, or through the influence of popular media. As a result, the 
deviant act may be seen as less taboo or controversial, and individuals 
engaging in the behavior may face less stigma or consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>In the debate about the 'managerial revolution', John Scott (1997) argued that:</td><td>owners still exercised control through groups of shareholders and interlocking directorships</td><td>the
 rise of managerial expertise and authority within organizations 
represents a fundamental shift in the way power and control are 
exercised, leading to a transformation in the nature of organizational 
structures and processes. This shift is characterized by the increasing 
autonomy and influence of professional managers over traditional 
business owners and executives, as well as the expansion of managerial 
roles and responsibilities in decision-making and strategic planning. 
Scott's argument highlights the significance of the managerial 
revolution in reshaping the dynamics of modern organizations and the 
ways in which they are managed and governed.</td></tr><tr><td>Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of:</td><td>women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy</td><td>
1. Economic exploitation: Marxist feminists argue that patriarchy is 
maintained through economic means, such as unequal pay for women, 
limited access to resources and opportunities, and the expectation that 
women will perform unpaid domestic labor. This economic exploitation 
reinforces the power dynamics that keep women subordinate to men in 
society.

2. Capitalist system: Marxist feminists also believe that capitalism 
relies on patriarchy to function, as the exploitation of women’s labor
 in the home and in the workforce helps to maintain profits for the 
ruling class. The capitalist system exploits women’s labor and 
reinforces gender norms that oppress women.

3. Class struggle: Marxist feminists view patriarchy as a tool of the 
ruling class to divide the working class and prevent solidarity among 
all oppressed groups. By pitting men against women and reinforcing 
traditional gender roles, the ruling class maintains power and prevents 
the working class from organizing against them.

4. Intersectionality: Marxist feminists also recognize that patriarchy 
intersects with other systems of oppression, such as racism, 
colonialism, and ableism, to create unique and compounding forms of 
oppression for marginalized groups. This intersectional approach helps 
to understand how multiple interconnected systems of power work together
 to reinforce patriarchy and maintain inequality.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following was not defined by Giddens (1998) as part of New Labour's 'third way':</td><td>putting an end to privatization</td><td>Privatization.</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-psychiatrists like Laing &amp; Esterson believed that:</td><td>Behaviour that seemed bizarre could be seen as a reasonable response to disturbed patterns of family interaction</td><td>
 mental illness was a result of societal and environmental factors, 
rather than a biological or genetic cause. They criticized the 
traditional psychiatric model for focusing on symptoms and labeling 
individuals as mentally ill, rather than addressing the root causes of 
their distress. They advocated for a more humanistic approach to mental 
health care, emphasizing the importance of understanding and validating 
people's experiences and emotions. Anti-psychiatrists also challenged 
the power dynamics between psychiatrists and patients, arguing that the 
medicalization of mental illness can be harmful and disempowering. 
Overall, they believed in a more compassionate and holistic 
understanding of mental health that considered the social, cultural, and
 interpersonal context of individuals' struggles.</td></tr><tr><td>Butler &amp; Stokes (1969) suggested that working class support for the Labour Party arose from:</td><td>socialization into working class families and communities</td><td>
1. Identification with the party's commitment to social justice and 
equality.
2. Economic policies that promised to benefit working-class individuals 
and communities.
3. Historical ties between the Labour Party and trade unions, which 
often represent working-class interests.
4. The perception that the Labour Party is more likely to address the 
needs and concerns of working-class people compared to other political 
parties.</td></tr><tr><td>In contemporary societies, social institutions are:</td><td>highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices</td><td>Organizations
 or structures that have been established to fulfill specific societal 
needs and functions, such as education, government, healthcare, 
religion, and the media. These institutions play a crucial role in 
maintaining social order, facilitating cooperation, and providing 
services to members of society. Additionally, social institutions help 
to shape individual behavior, beliefs, and values, and their functioning
 is often influenced by social norms, cultural practices, and power 
dynamics.</td></tr><tr><td>The term 'emotion work' (Hochschild 1983) refers to:</td><td>the techniques used to consciously manage and present emotions that are deemed appropriate for public settings of interaction</td><td>
 the process of managing, expressing, and suppressing one's emotions in 
order to meet social and professional expectations. This can involve 
controlling one's emotions in order to appear professional at work, or 
projecting certain emotions to create a certain impression on others. 
Emotion work is often performed by individuals in service-oriented 
professions, such as nurses, flight attendants, and customer service 
representatives, where interpersonal interactions are a key part of the 
job.</td></tr><tr><td>When sociologists study the structure of layers in society and people's movement between them, they call this:</td><td>social stratification</td><td>social stratification</td></tr><tr><td>The
 four ideal types of social action that Weber identified were as 
follows: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and...</td><td>affectual</td><td> affectual.</td></tr><tr><td>An ecclesia is:</td><td>a religious organization that claims total spiritual authority over its members</td><td>a
 formal assembly or gathering of individuals for religious purposes, 
typically used in reference to Christian churches. It can also refer to a
 particular Christian denomination or branch of Christianity.</td></tr><tr><td>After
 slavery was abolished in the USA and British Empire, policy makers 
claimed that former slaves migrating to these cities would experience:</td><td>assimilation</td><td>1.
 Economic opportunities: Policy makers argued that former slaves would 
have access to better economic opportunities in urban areas, where there
 were more jobs and industries than in rural areas.

2. Freedom and independence: Former slaves were promised a chance to 
experience greater freedom and independence in urban areas, where they 
would have more personal autonomy and control over their lives.

3. Social integration: Policy makers believed that moving to cities 
would allow former slaves to integrate into mainstream society, interact
 with people from different backgrounds, and participate more fully in 
the social and cultural life of the country.

4. Education and advancement: Urban areas were seen as offering better 
educational opportunities for former slaves, allowing them to gain 
skills and knowledge that would help them advance in their careers and 
improve their socio-economic status.

5. Improved living conditions: Policy makers argued that cities would 
provide better living conditions for former slaves, with access to 
better housing, healthcare, and other social services than in rural 
areas.</td></tr><tr><td>Sutherland's study of the 'professional thief' suggested that:</td><td>people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms</td><td>professional
 thieves are skilled and strategic in their criminal activities, often 
working together in organized groups. They carefully plan their crimes, 
target wealthy individuals or businesses, and take measures to avoid 
detection by law enforcement. They may also have a code of ethics or 
loyalty to other members of their criminal network. Overall, 
Sutherland's study highlighted the calculated and sophisticated nature 
of professional thieves and the importance of understanding their 
motivations and behaviors in order to prevent and combat criminal 
activity.</td></tr><tr><td>Which of the following policies did the New Labour government not pursue?</td><td>supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing</td><td>- Introduction of the National Minimum Wage
- Devolution of power to Scotland and Wales
- Abolition of the House of Lords
- Privatization of the National Health Service</td></tr><tr><td>Stone's research suggests that prior to industrialization, the nuclear family:</td><td>had begun to emerge through the separation of work and home life</td><td>was
 not the predominant family structure, but rather extended families 
living under one roof or in close proximity were more common.</td></tr><tr><td>Statistics
 about rural, suburban, and urban patterns of development and mobility 
are almost always reported based on a geographical area labeled as 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). What constitutes an MSA?</td><td>It is composed of at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and it surrounds densely urbanized counties.</td><td>An
 MSA is a geographical region typically consisting of a central city and
 its surrounding suburbs, as well as any adjacent counties that are 
economically and socially integrated with the central city. The criteria
 for defining an MSA include the population size of the central city, 
the population density of the region, and the level of economic 
integration among the different parts of the region. MSAs are used by 
the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies to collect data and
 analyze trends related to population growth, economic activity, and 
patterns of development and mobility.</td></tr><tr><td>Mosca and Pareto identified the ruling elite as:</td><td>all of the above</td><td>the
 "natural aristocracy" or the "elite minority" who hold power and 
influence in society. They believed that this elite minority dominated 
politics, economics, and culture, shaping society according to their own
 interests.</td></tr><tr><td>Bourdieu attributed the reproduction of class to:</td><td>cultural capital</td><td>cultural
 capital, economic capital, and social capital. He argued that 
individuals inherit various forms of capital from their families and 
communities, which in turn determines their social position and 
opportunities for mobility. This reproduction of class is perpetuated 
through practices such as education, social networks, and cultural 
tastes that favor individuals with higher levels of capital.</td></tr><tr><td>Secularization involves the two related ideas of:</td><td>disengagement and disenchantment</td><td>1.
 The decline in the influence of religion in society, particularly in 
terms of its impact on the personal beliefs and practices of 
individuals.
2. The increasing prominence of secular, non-religious institutions and 
ideologies in shaping societal values, norms, and systems of authority.</td></tr><tr><td>The general fertility rate fell between 1964 and 2000 because of:</td><td>increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins</td><td>
1. Increasing availability and use of contraceptives: The introduction 
of birth control pills and other forms of contraception made it easier 
for couples to plan and space their pregnancies, leading to a decline in
 the general fertility rate.

2. Changing social norms and expectations: As more women entered the 
workforce and pursued higher education, the societal pressure to have 
large families decreased, leading to a decline in fertility rates.

3. Economic factors: The rising cost of raising children, housing, and 
education made it more difficult for many families to afford to have 
multiple children, leading to a decline in the general fertility rate.

4. Delayed childbearing: Many couples chose to delay starting a family 
in order to focus on their careers or other goals, leading to a decline 
in the general fertility rate.

5. Increased access to education and reproductive healthcare: Improved 
access to education and healthcare, including family planning services, 
allowed individuals to make more informed choices about their 
reproductive health, leading to a decline in the general fertility rate.</td></tr><tr><td>Howard's idea of the garden city consisted of:</td><td>six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city</td><td>- A separation of industrial, residential, and agricultural areas within the city to prevent overcrowding and pollution
- Green spaces and parks dispersed throughout the city to provide residents with access to nature and fresh air
- The integration of public transportation to reduce reliance on cars and promote walkability
- Community involvement in planning and decision-making processes to ensure that the needs and desires of residents are met
- A focus on sustainability and environmental conservation, with an emphasis on renewable energy sources and waste reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>The 'third age' of the life course is said to involve:</td><td>active non-work and independence after retirement</td><td>- Retirement or a transition away from full-time work
- Increased leisure time and opportunities for travel and hobbies
- Changes in familial and social relationships
- Potential health challenges or concerns
- Increased focus on personal growth, learning, and pursuing interests
- Reflecting on and sharing wisdom and life experiences with younger generations</td></tr><tr><td>Weber (1919) said that the state's monopoly of the use of force was legitimated by:</td><td>rational-legal authority</td><td>
1. Tradition - The historical legitimacy and continuity of the state as 
the central governing authority.

2. Charisma - The belief in the extraordinary qualities and inherent 
right to rule of certain individuals or leaders.

3. Rational-legal authority - The system of laws and regulations that 
govern the state, providing a rational basis for the use of force.</td></tr><tr><td>Sullivan's (2000) study suggested that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when:</td><td>they were unemployed or both partners worked full time</td><td>

- They were younger and had not yet established their careers.
- They had higher levels of education.
- They were in egalitarian relationships where both partners shared responsibilities equally.
- They had positive attitudes towards gender equality and believed in sharing household tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>The shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce means that:</td><td>both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children</td><td>
 both parents are now more involved in their children's lives and share 
parenting responsibilities. This shift can benefit children by allowing 
them to maintain relationships with both parents and have a greater 
sense of stability and support. It also requires parents to communicate 
and cooperate with each other in making decisions about their children's
 well-being. Overall, the shift to joint parenthood can help minimize 
the negative impacts of divorce on children and promote their healthy 
development.</td></tr><tr><td>The term "sociology" was coined in the early 1800s by which of the following?</td><td>Auguste Comte</td><td>The term "sociology" was coined by French philosopher Auguste Comte in the early 1800s.</td></tr><tr><td>In their study of depression, Brown &amp; Harris (1978) found that:</td><td>women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support</td><td>

1. Women were more likely to experience depression than men.
2. Negative life events, such as loss of a loved one or unemployment, 
were strongly associated with the onset of depression.
3. Individuals with a history of early life adversity, such as childhood
 trauma or abuse, were more vulnerable to developing depression in 
response to negative life events.
4. Social support and coping mechanisms played a significant role in 
protecting individuals from developing depression in the face of 
adversity.
5. The experience of multiple and chronic stressors increased the risk 
of developing depression.
6. Sociodemographic factors, such as socioeconomic status and education 
level, also influenced the likelihood of experiencing depression.</td></tr><tr><td>The alternative form of 'network organization' means that:</td><td>work can be subcontracted out to independent suppliers and retailers</td><td>The
 alternative form of 'network organization' refers to a decentralized 
and flexible organizational structure where individuals or groups within
 the organization are connected in a network-like structure. This form 
of organization facilitates collaboration, communication, and 
decision-making without traditional hierarchical levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Margaret Mead suggested that:</td><td>adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined</td><td>"Never
 doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change 
the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."</td></tr><tr><td>The term 'secondary deviation' refers to:</td><td>all of the above</td><td>A
 concept within labeling theory that describes how individuals who have 
been labeled as deviant may eventually internalize and embrace this 
label, leading to a further increase in deviant behavior as they conform
 to the expectations and stereotypes associated with the label. This can
 result in a self-fulfilling prophecy where individuals continue to 
engage in deviant behavior due to being stigmatized and marginalized by 
society.</td></tr><tr><td>The effect of the Internet upon the public sphere has been to:</td><td>revive it, by reaffirming a commitment to freedom of speech</td><td>
 greatly expand and democratize it. The Internet allows for easier and 
faster access to information, enables more people to participate in 
discussions and debates, and provides a platform for voices that may 
have previously been marginalized or ignored. This increased access to 
information and communication has led to a more diverse and inclusive 
public sphere, where a wide range of perspectives and opinions can be 
shared and debated. However, the Internet has also raised concerns about
 the spread of misinformation, filter bubbles, and echo chambers, which 
can limit the quality of public discourse and the ability of individuals
 to engage with different viewpoints.</td></tr><tr><td>Weber said that the 'spirit of capitalism' could be traced back to:</td><td>Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation</td><td>the
 Protestant work ethic, particularly the teachings of John Calvin and 
the idea of predestination. Calvin emphasized frugality, hard work, and 
personal responsibility as signs of being chosen by God for salvation, 
leading individuals to see accumulating wealth through work as a 
demonstration of their faith. This ideology laid the foundation for the 
development of modern capitalism, according to Weber.</td></tr><tr><td>The terms 'crisis of the 1970s' is used to refer to:</td><td>declining profits and rising unemployment</td><td>a
 series of economic, social, and political challenges that occurred in 
the 1970s, including high inflation, rising unemployment, a global oil 
crisis, and geopolitical tensions.</td></tr><tr><td>The Macpherson Report highlighted the increasing problem of:</td><td>institutional racism: systematic forms of disadvantage built into the routines and practices of social institutions</td><td>racial discrimination and inequality in policing.</td></tr><tr><td>Seven people standing silently while waiting for a bus at a bus stop is an example of which of the following?</td><td>An aggregate</td><td>Group behavior</td></tr><tr><td>Environmentalist social movements are global in the sense that:</td><td>all of the above</td><td>
 they are focused on addressing environmental issues that affect the 
planet as a whole, such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution.
 These movements transcend national boundaries and work to create change
 on an international scale. Environmentalist social movements also often
 collaborate with other organizations and individuals from around the 
world to advocate for policy changes and promote sustainable practices.</td></tr><tr><td>Chodorow (1978) argued that gender socialization occurred through:</td><td>both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away</td><td>

1. Parental influences: Parents play a significant role in gender 
socialization by shaping their children's behaviors and attitudes 
towards gender roles. They may treat boys and girls differently, provide
 them with different toys, activities, and opportunities based on their 
gender.

2. Peer influences: Peers also play a crucial role in gender 
socialization by reinforcing gender stereotypes and expectations. 
Children learn about gender roles and behaviors through interaction with
 their peers, who may model and reinforce traditional gender norms.

3. Media influences: The media also plays a significant role in gender 
socialization by providing children with images and messages about 
gender roles and expectations. Television shows, movies, advertisements,
 and other forms of media often portray gender in stereotypical ways, 
which can influence children's perceptions and attitudes towards gender.

4. Educational influences: Schools and other educational settings can 
also play a role in gender socialization by reinforcing gender 
stereotypes and expectations. Teachers may unintentionally treat boys 
and girls differently or provide them with different opportunities based
 on their gender.

Overall, Chodorow argued that gender socialization occurs through a 
combination of these various influences, shaping individuals' 
understanding of gender roles and expectations from a young age.</td></tr><tr><td>The 'new man' of the 1980s was alleged to be:</td><td>sensitive, caring, and emotional</td><td>
 ambitious, career-driven, fashionable, confident, and physically fit. 
He was seen as someone who valued success, material wealth, and 
self-improvement. The new man of the 1980s was often portrayed in 
popular culture as a more emotionally expressive and sensitive 
counterpart to the traditional 'macho man' stereotype.</td></tr><tr><td>In the 1960s, comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because:</td><td>selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while the comprehensives put children into ability streams</td><td>1.
 Despite their intentions, comprehensive schools did not always succeed 
in providing equal opportunities for all students. There were still 
disparities in resources, teacher quality, and academic support between 
schools in wealthier areas and those in poorer areas.

2. The streaming and setting system within comprehensive schools often 
perpetuated existing class divisions, as students were often grouped 
based on perceived ability or social background, leading to further 
inequality.

3. Socioeconomic factors outside of the school environment, such as 
poverty, lack of access to educational resources at home, and cultural 
expectations, continued to have a significant impact on students' 
academic success.

4. The attitudes and prejudices of teachers and administrators towards 
students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds also played a role in 
perpetuating class inequalities within the education system.

5. The overall structure of the education system, including the 
influence of private schools and the existence of selective grammar 
schools, also hindered the ability of comprehensive schools to 
completely eradicate class inequalities in education.</td></tr><tr><td>In idealized views of science, the experimental method is said to involve:</td><td>isolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another</td><td>1. Formulating a hypothesis or research question
2. Designing and conducting controlled experiments to test the hypothesis
3. Collecting data through careful observation and measurement
4. Analyzing and interpreting the data to draw conclusions
5. Reporting findings through scientific publications or presentations
6. Repeating experiments to validate results and ensure reproducibility.</td></tr><tr><td>An 'open' society is one that:</td><td>allows people to move between levels of the hierarchy</td><td>

1. Allows for freedom of speech, expression, and assembly

2. Values diversity and inclusion

3. Encourages dialogue and exchange of ideas

4. Respects individual rights and liberties

5. Embraces transparency and accountability in governance.</td></tr><tr><td>The Nation of Islam group appealed to:</td><td>African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA</td><td>African
 Americans and others who have faced discrimination and oppression based
 on their race and ethnicity. The Nation of Islam's message of Black 
empowerment, self-reliance, and unity resonated with many who were 
seeking a sense of identity and community in the face of systemic racism
 and inequality. The group also appealed to those who were disillusioned
 with mainstream Christianity and sought a more inclusive and radical 
interpretation of religion.</td></tr><tr><td>Economic aid has largely failed to promote modernization in the developing countries because:</td><td>debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received</td><td>

1. Aid often comes with conditions attached, such as government reforms 
or foreign investment requirements, which may not always align with the 
priorities and needs of the recipient country.

2. Aid can sometimes create a cycle of dependency, where developing 
countries become reliant on external assistance rather than developing 
their own economic capacity.

3. Aid can be mismanaged or used for corrupt purposes, diverting 
resources away from productive uses and hindering development.

4. Aid may not always be targeted effectively, leading to inefficient 
allocation of resources and limited impact on economic development.

5. Lack of accountability and transparency in aid distribution can lead 
to the funds not reaching the intended beneficiaries or being used for 
unintended purposes.

6. Aid can distort incentives and market mechanisms, leading to 
inefficiencies and hindering the development of a competitive and modern
 economy.

7. In some cases, aid can also lead to conflicts and tensions within the
 recipient country, as different groups vie for control over aid 
resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Giselle graduated from college with high 
honors in management. She was recruited immediately following college by
 a large corporation and accepted a position in junior management. She 
quickly advanced to middle management. Ten years later Giselle was still
 in a middle-management position and had witnessed junior male 
colleagues promoted over her. Which of the following is a phenomenon 
that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion?</td><td>Glass ceiling</td><td>The
 phenomenon that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion 
is gender bias or the glass ceiling effect. This is a situation where 
women, despite their qualifications and performance, are prevented from 
advancing to higher positions in the corporate hierarchy due to gender 
discrimination.</td></tr><tr><td>The Mafia is an example of:</td><td>organized crime</td><td>organized crime.</td></tr><tr><td>Goldthorpe identified the 'service class' as:</td><td>those in non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state</td><td>A
 social class characterized by individuals employed in professional or 
managerial roles in industry or business, typically having higher levels
 of education and income. This class is distinct from the working class 
and the traditional middle class.</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial production in the nineteenth century was characterized by:</td><td>power-driven machinery and the concentration of workers in large workplaces</td><td>1.
 The rise of factories and mass production: The use of steam power, 
mechanized equipment, and assembly lines revolutionized manufacturing 
processes, leading to a significant increase in production output.

2. Urbanization: The growth of factories and industries in urban areas 
attracted a large influx of rural migrants seeking employment 
opportunities, leading to the rapid expansion of cities and towns.

3. Division of labor: Workers were assigned specific tasks within the 
production process, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity 
but also contributing to the dehumanization of labor.

4. Exploitation of labor: Workers, including women and children, often 
faced harsh working conditions, long hours, low wages, and lack of 
rights and protections.

5. Technological advancements: Innovations such as the steam engine, 
railroads, telegraphs, and the Bessemer process for steelmaking played a
 crucial role in driving industrial production forward.

6. Growth of capitalism: The industrial revolution led to the emergence 
of a capitalist economic system, with factory owners and industrialists 
accumulating wealth and power through the exploitation of labor and 
resources.

7. Environmental impact: The rapid industrialization and unchecked 
pollution led to significant environmental degradation, including air 
and water pollution, deforestation, and habitat destruction.

8. Globalization: The industrial revolution facilitated the growth of 
international trade and imperialism, with industrialized countries 
exploiting colonies and resources in developing nations to fuel their 
own industrial production.</td></tr><tr><td>The term 'collective consumption' (Castells 1977) refers to:</td><td>the provision of health, housing, and education services by the state</td><td>
 the process by which resources, goods, and services are consumed 
collectively by a group or community, rather than by individuals acting 
independently. This can include shared public goods such as parks, 
libraries, and public transportation, as well as pooled resources for 
things like food, housing, and healthcare. Collective consumption is 
often seen as a way to promote sharing, equality, and community 
cohesion, and can be an important factor in shaping social and economic 
relations within society.</td></tr><tr><td>The deviant subculture of homosexuals who met in seventeenth and eighteenth century London was called the:</td><td>mollies</td><td>"Molly houses"</td></tr><tr><td>Robert and Tanya are married and live with their three children. Their family unit is called</td><td>a nuclear family</td><td> a nuclear family.</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
